# Archipelago Manual for Touhou games
You will need [Thprac](https://github.com/touhouworldcup/thprac) in order to choose your stage with your starting resources

## Locations
* MidBoss Defeated
* MidBoss Drop
* Boss Defeated
* Gimmicks depending on the game

## Items
* Characters/Shot Types
* Stages
* Pack of 25 Power Point
* Number of Lives
* Number of Bombs
* Progressive Difficulty (Descending)
* [Touhou 18] Ability Cards

**Filler**: 1 or 0.01 Power Point

**Goal**: Beat the final boss X number of time (Where X is defined in the YAML and is 1 per character)

## Notes
### General
* You start with 1 random Character/Shot Type and the first stage
* Each locations exist for each Character (not for each Shot Type)
* In order to not be unfair since not everybody can 1CC Lunatic NMNB. You can choose in the YAML how much resources you are expected to have for the level 3/4 and 4/5
* The number of bombs currently affect only your first life. Up to you if you limit yourself when you lose a life or not
* I didn't do Touhou 9 and 19. I will see if I can think of a randomizer that work for them but no guarantee

### Touhou 8
* You will need a save with the individual character unlocked
* Stage 6A and 6B both count has a final stage, the number max of Ending to get can therefore be 8 (2 per Team)

### Touhou 18
* You will need a save with all Ablilty Cards unlocked
* It has a shop system, you unlock a random shop when finishing a stage and use the money you've got during the stage. 
* You keep your money between stage, you can therefore farm it and buy items whenever you want
* The price of the items are random. Ideally, I would like the items to be known before buying them but as far as I know, there is no method in Archipelago Manual to hint a group of location when you get another location
